            Woodcarving of Meghalaya
          </h1>
          <p className="mb-4 text-dark-gray">
            One of the cottage businesses in the state is woodcarving.
            Originally created by the tribal people in the Garo Hills,
            woodcarving is now prevalent throughout the entire state. Wooden
            sculptures are a regular sight in Meghalayan temples. The artists
            carve toys for hours, mostly including people, animals, and birds.
            You can purchase these amazing sculptures at Shillong's handicraft
            market. The primary retail hubs of the city are Laitumkhrah and
            Police Bazaar. Another well-known market where you can enjoy the
            beauty and aroma of Meghalayan handicrafts is Bara Bazaar.

          <p className="mb-4 text-dark-gray">
            Meghalaya has an abundance of cane and bamboo. Khasis create Tlieng,
            a distinctive style of robust cane mat. Meghalayan bamboo crafts
            have gained popularity on the global scene throughout time. The
            artwork is frequently distributed to stores all around the world.
            The craftsmen' creations include baskets, mats, stools, and
            umbrellas. The Khasi fruit basket, which is built of specialised
            cane to store fruits and frequently vegetables, the Khasi pig
            basket, which is made of bamboo sticks used to transport pigs, and

            Beautiful handwoven textile
          </h1>
          <p className="mb-4 text-dark-gray">
            Examining Meghalaya's remarkable textile sector is essential to
            understanding the state's handicrafts. The people here preserve
            their cultural heritage by designing distinctive patterns onto
            shawls, clothes, and other cloth-based household products. The
            toughness and texture of Eri silk make it highly valued in
            Meghalaya. The traditional garment worn by ladies in Meghalaya is
            called Jainsen, and it is made of mulberry silk. When in Shillong,
            remember to pick up a vibrant shawl as a keepsake. Meghalaya Angami
            shawls are reminiscent of the splendour of Meghalaya's past, crafted
            from wool or multicoloured threads. The most well-known textile
            stitches are the Taipchi, Pashni, and Mikir stitches. Meghalayan
            crafts are timeless and always changing in step with technology.
